This repo contains the following:

  1. R script that cleans the data from the UCI Machine Learning Repository
  2. CodeBook that explains the R Script
  3. Additionally, I submitted a .txt file with the R script containing the Tidy Dataset
  
This is for the Getting and Cleaning Data Project for Johns Hopkins University
